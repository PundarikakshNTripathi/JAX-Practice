    "# 📘 Notebook 6: Neural Networks & Fraud Detection - Putting It All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the grand finale! This notebook brings together **everything you've learned** to build a real fraud detection system from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn (40-50 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have built:\n",
    "- ✅ A complete neural network classifier in JAX\n",
    "- ✅ A real-world fraud detection model\n",
    "- ✅ End-to-end training pipeline\n",
    "- ✅ Performance evaluation and metrics\n",
    "- ✅ Model interpretation and analysis\n",
    "- ✅ Practical deployment considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is where theory meets practice!** 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 What is Fraud Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Real-World Problem\n",
    "Credit card companies process millions of transactions daily. A tiny fraction (<0.2%) are fraudulent, but catching them is critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- **Extreme imbalance:** 99.8% legitimate, 0.2% fraud\n",
    "- **High stakes:** Miss fraud = $$ lost; False alarm = angry customer\n",
    "- **Real-time:** Must decide in milliseconds\n",
    "- **Evolving patterns:** Fraudsters constantly adapt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal:** Build a neural network that identifies fraudulent transactions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection\n",
    "**Source:** Real credit card transactions from European cardholders (anonymized)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size:** 284,807 transactions over 2 days\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "- `Time`: Seconds since first transaction\n",
    "- `V1-V28`: Anonymized features (PCA transformed for privacy)\n",
    "- `Amount`: Transaction amount\n",
    "- `Class`: 0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset?**\n",
    "- Real-world imbalanced classification problem\n",
    "- Demonstrates practical ML challenges\n",
    "- Commonly used benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Build\n",
    "A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** with:\n",
    "- **Input layer:** Features from the dataset (V1-V28 + Time + Amount, typically 29-30 features)\n",
    "- **Hidden layer 1:** 64 neurons + ReLU activation\n",
    "- **Hidden layer 2:** 32 neurons + ReLU activation\n",
    "- **Hidden layer 3:** 16 neurons + ReLU activation\n",
    "- **Output layer:** 1 neuron + Sigmoid activation (probability of fraud)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture?\n",
    "- **Not too complex:** Small dataset (284K samples) doesn't need huge network\n",
    "- **Enough capacity:** 3 hidden layers can learn complex patterns\n",
    "- **Fast training:** Small enough to train on CPU in minutes\n",
    "- **Proven effective:** This architecture works well for tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Diagram\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (dynamic) → Dense(64) + ReLU → Dense(32) + ReLU → Dense(16) + ReLU → Dense(1) + Sigmoid → Fraud Probability\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "**Simple answer:** A function that learns patterns from data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Takes input features (transaction data)\n",
    "2. Multiplies by weights and adds biases (learned parameters)\n",
    "3. Applies activation functions (introduces non-linearity)\n",
    "4. Produces output (fraud probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning = adjusting weights to minimize errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**\n",
    "- Formula: `max(0, x)`\n",
    "- Purpose: Introduces non-linearity (lets network learn complex patterns)\n",
    "- Why: Simple, fast, works well\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sigmoid:**\n",
    "- Formula: `1 / (1 + e^(-x))`\n",
    "- Purpose: Squashes output to [0, 1] range\n",
    "- Why: Perfect for probabilities!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy\n",
    "**What:** Measures how wrong the model's predictions are\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** `-[y*log(p) + (1-y)*log(1-p)]`\n",
    "- `y`: True label (0 or 1)\n",
    "- `p`: Predicted probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Penalizes confident wrong predictions heavily\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "**What:** Algorithm that updates weights to minimize loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1. Compute gradient (how to change weights to reduce loss)\n",
    "2. Update: `weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient`\n",
    "3. Repeat until loss stops decreasing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning rate:** Step size (too big = unstable, too small = slow)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Metrics for Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy is misleading!**\n",
    "- If 99.8% are legitimate, predicting \"all legitimate\" gives 99.8% accuracy\n",
    "- But catches ZERO fraud!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better metrics explained:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Confusion Matrix - The Foundation**\n",
    "Every prediction falls into one of four categories:\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    Predicted: Fraud    Predicted: Legitimate\n",
    "Actual: Fraud       TP (True Positive)  FN (False Negative)\n",
    "Actual: Legitimate  FP (False Positive) TN (True Negative)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **TP (True Positive):** Correctly caught fraud ✅ (Good!)\n",
    "- **TN (True Negative):** Correctly identified legitimate ✅ (Good!)\n",
    "- **FP (False Positive):** Flagged legitimate as fraud ❌ (Annoying customer)\n",
    "- **FN (False Negative):** Missed actual fraud ❌ (Lost money!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Precision - \"How accurate are our fraud alerts?\"**\n",
    "**Formula:** `Precision = TP / (TP + FP)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:** Of all transactions we flagged as fraud, what percentage were actually fraud?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "- Flagged 100 transactions as fraud (our predictions)\n",
    "- Only 80 were actually fraud (true positives)\n",
    "- 20 were legitimate (false positives - we annoyed 20 customers!)\n",
    "- Precision = 80/100 = 0.80 or 80%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **High precision (close to 1.0):** Few false alarms, customers rarely get bothered\n",
    "- **Low precision (close to 0.0):** Many false alarms, customers get angry\n",
    "- **Target:** Usually want >0.70 (70%) in fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Recall (Sensitivity) - \"How many frauds did we catch?\"**\n",
    "**Formula:** `Recall = TP / (TP + FN)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:** Of all actual fraud cases, what percentage did we successfully catch?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- 100 actual fraud transactions happened (reality)\n",
    "- We caught 90 of them (true positives)\n",
    "- We missed 10 (false negatives - lost money!)\n",
    "- Recall = 90/100 = 0.90 or 90%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **High recall (close to 1.0):** Catching most frauds, minimizing losses\n",
    "- **Low recall (close to 0.0):** Missing many frauds, big financial loss!\n",
    "- **Target:** Usually want >0.80 (80%) in fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Precision-Recall Trade-off**\n",
    "**The dilemma:** You can't maximize both simultaneously!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make model more sensitive (predict fraud more often):**\n",
    "- ↑ Recall increases (catch more frauds) ✅\n",
    "- ↓ Precision decreases (more false alarms) ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make model more conservative (predict fraud less often):**\n",
    "- ↑ Precision increases (fewer false alarms) ✅\n",
    "- ↓ Recall decreases (miss more frauds) ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world decision:**\n",
    "- Banks often prefer **higher recall** (catch frauds, even with false alarms)\n",
    "- Why? Losing $1000 to fraud >> annoying one customer with a call\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **F1-Score - \"Overall balance of precision and recall\"**\n",
    "**Formula:** `F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:** Harmonic mean that balances precision and recall. Only high if BOTH are high!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenarios:**\n",
    "- Precision=0.90, Recall=0.90 → F1=0.90 (Excellent! ⭐)\n",
    "- Precision=0.95, Recall=0.50 → F1=0.66 (Unbalanced)\n",
    "- Precision=0.50, Recall=0.95 → F1=0.66 (Unbalanced)\n",
    "- Precision=1.00, Recall=0.10 → F1=0.18 (Terrible!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **F1 > 0.80:** Excellent model for imbalanced data\n",
    "- **F1 = 0.60-0.80:** Good, room for improvement\n",
    "- **F1 < 0.60:** Poor, needs significant work\n",
    "- **Why use it:** Single metric that punishes extreme imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve)**\n",
    "**Formula:** Area under the Precision-Recall curve across all thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:** How well the model performs across ALL possible decision thresholds (0.1, 0.5, 0.9, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threshold concept:**\n",
    "- Model outputs probability: 0.83 = \"83% chance of fraud\"\n",
    "- We pick threshold (e.g., 0.5): if prob ≥ 0.5, predict fraud\n",
    "- Different thresholds give different precision/recall trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Threshold=0.9 (very strict): High precision, low recall (few predictions)\n",
    "- Threshold=0.3 (very lenient): Low precision, high recall (many predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **PR-AUC = 1.0:** Perfect model (impossible in practice)\n",
    "- **PR-AUC > 0.80:** Excellent performance\n",
    "- **PR-AUC = 0.40-0.80:** Decent to good\n",
    "- **PR-AUC < 0.40:** Poor, barely better than random\n",
    "- **Baseline:** Random guessing = fraud prevalence rate (0.002 for this dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use PR-AUC:** Best metric for imbalanced data! Better than ROC-AUC because it focuses on the minority class (fraud).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)**\n",
    "**Formula:** Area under the ROC curve (True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:** Model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:**\n",
    "- True Positive Rate (TPR) = Recall = TP/(TP+FN)\n",
    "- False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP/(FP+TN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC = 1.0:** Perfect discrimination\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC > 0.90:** Excellent\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC = 0.70-0.90:** Good\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC = 0.50:** Random guessing (useless!)\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC < 0.50:** Worse than random (model is backwards!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat for imbalanced data:** \n",
    "- ROC-AUC can be misleading with severe imbalance (like 577:1)\n",
    "- May look good even when model performs poorly on minority class\n",
    "- **Prefer PR-AUC for this fraud dataset!**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Quick Decision Guide:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question                          → Metric to Check\n",
    "---------------------------       → -----------------\n",
    "\"Are fraud alerts accurate?\"      → Precision\n",
    "\"Are we catching most frauds?\"    → Recall  \n",
    "\"Overall balance of both?\"        → F1-Score\n",
    "\"Performance across thresholds?\"  → PR-AUC (best for imbalance)\n",
    "\"General discrimination ability?\" → ROC-AUC\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What's \"Good\" for Fraud Detection?**\n",
    "Based on industry standards:\n",
    "- **Precision:** 0.70-0.90 (70-90%)\n",
    "- **Recall:** 0.75-0.95 (75-95%)\n",
    "- **F1-Score:** 0.70-0.85 (70-85%)\n",
    "- **PR-AUC:** 0.60-0.90 (60-90%)\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC:** 0.85-0.98 (85-98%)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** There's always a trade-off! The \"best\" model depends on business priorities (lose money vs. annoy customers).\n",

    "## 📚 Part 1: Understanding Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Data Preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like cooking:** Before you cook a meal, you need to prep ingredients - wash vegetables, cut meat, measure spices. Similarly, before training a neural network, you need to prep your data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw data → Preprocessed data → Model training → Predictions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Can't We Use Raw Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: Different Scales**\n",
    "- Feature 1 (Transaction Amount): ranges from $0 to $10,000\n",
    "- Feature 2 (Time): ranges from 0 to 172,792 seconds\n",
    "- Neural networks struggle when features have vastly different scales!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Standardization (make all features have similar ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2: Data Leakage**\n",
    "- If we train and test on the same data, model just memorizes!\n",
    "- Like studying with the exact test questions - cheating!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Split data into train/validation/test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3: Class Imbalance**\n",
    "- 99.8% legitimate, 0.2% fraud\n",
    "- Model learns to always predict \"legitimate\" and gets 99.8% accuracy!\n",
    "- But catches zero fraud!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Class weights (penalize errors on rare class more)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Pipeline (Step-by-Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Load Raw Data**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = fetch_openml('creditcard')  # Download dataset\n",
    "```\n",
    "**What happens:** Downloads 284,807 credit card transactions with 30 features\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Separate Features and Labels**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = features (V1, V2, ..., V28, Time, Amount)\n",
    "y = labels (0=legitimate, 1=fraud)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Model learns from X (inputs) to predict y (outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Train/Validation/Test Split**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Three Sets:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set (70%):** Model learns from this\n",
    "   - Like practice problems when studying\n",
    "   - Model adjusts weights to minimize errors here\n",
    "   - Example: 199,365 transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation Set (15%):** Tune hyperparameters\n",
    "   - Like practice exams before the real test\n",
    "   - Check if model is overfitting (memorizing instead of learning)\n",
    "   - Helps decide when to stop training\n",
    "   - Example: 42,721 transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Set (15%):** Final evaluation (touch ONCE at the end!)\n",
    "   - Like the real exam\n",
    "   - Model has never seen this data during training\n",
    "   - Gives honest assessment of real-world performance\n",
    "   - Example: 42,721 transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Rule:** NEVER train on validation or test data! That's cheating!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratified Splitting:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train_test_split(..., stratify=y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Ensures each split has the same fraud ratio (0.173%)\n",
    "- Without this, test set might have no fraud cases!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Feature Standardization (Normalization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Features have wildly different ranges\n",
    "- Time: [0, 172,792]\n",
    "- V1: [-56.4, 2.5]\n",
    "- Amount: [0, 25,691]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: StandardScaler**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # Learn mean & std, then transform\n",
    "X_val = scaler.transform(X_val)          # Use same mean & std from training\n",
    "X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)        # Use same mean & std from training\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Transforms each feature to have:\n",
    "- **Mean = 0** (centered around zero)\n",
    "- **Standard deviation = 1** (similar spread)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** `x_scaled = (x - mean) / std`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Amount: [10, 100, 1000]\n",
    "Mean: 370, Std: 500\n",
    "Scaled: [-0.72, -0.54, 1.26]  (all similar magnitude!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRITICAL:** \n",
    "- **Fit only on training data** (compute mean & std from training)\n",
    "- **Transform validation and test** using training statistics\n",
    "- Why? Test set should represent \"unseen future data\" - we won't know its statistics!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Handle Class Imbalance with Weights**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:**\n",
    "- 284,315 normal transactions\n",
    "- 492 fraud transactions\n",
    "- Ratio: 577:1 (extreme imbalance!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive approach:** Model predicts \"all normal\" → 99.8% accuracy, 0% fraud detection ❌\n",

    "**Solution: Class Weights**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Before preprocessing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Raw data: (284,807 transactions, 30 features)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After preprocessing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "X_train: (199,365, 29)  # 70% of data, standardized features\n",
    "y_train: (199,365,)     # Labels (0 or 1)\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Standardization:** Makes features comparable (same scale)\n",
    "✅ **Train/Val/Test Split:** Prevents cheating, gives honest evaluation\n",
    "✅ **Stratified Split:** Preserves class distribution across splits\n",
    "✅ **Class Weights:** Handles extreme imbalance (577:1 ratio)\n",
    "✅ **Fit on Train Only:** Never let model \"peek\" at validation/test statistics\n",
    "✅ **Test Set is Sacred:** Use only once at the very end!\n",

    "- Positive weight = \"this feature increases fraud probability\"\n",

    "**Why we need it:**\n",
    "- Without activation: Network is just linear (like y = mx + b)\n",
    "- With ReLU: Network can learn complex, non-linear patterns!\n",
    "- **Example:** \"Fraud happens when amount > 1000 AND time is between 2am-4am\" (non-linear!)\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Explicit parameter passing\n",
    "params = init_network_params(sizes, key)\n",
    "output = forward(params, x)\n",
    "loss, grads = value_and_grad(loss_fn)(params, x, y)\n",
    "params = update(params, grads, lr)  # Manual update\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Explicit control\n",
    "✅ Easy to compose transformations (jit + grad + vmap)\n",
    "✅ Faster with JIT compilation\n",
    "❌ More boilerplate code\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch (Object-Oriented):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Stateful model class\n",
    "model = NeuralNet()\n",
    "output = model(x)\n",
    "loss.backward()  # Automatic gradient computation\n",
    "optimizer.step()  # Automatic update\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Less boilerplate\n",
    "✅ Familiar to most ML practitioners\n",
    "✅ Great ecosystem\n",
    "❌ Less control over transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both produce same results!** Just different coding styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens During Training?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epoch 1:**\n",
    "- Weights are random → Predictions are random → Loss is high (≈0.7)\n",
    "- Gradients computed → Weights adjusted\n",
    "- Model slightly better at end of epoch 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epoch 2-5:**\n",
    "- Model learning quickly\n",
    "- Loss decreasing steadily (≈0.5 → 0.3)\n",
    "- Starting to recognize fraud patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epoch 6-10:**\n",
    "- Model refining predictions\n",
    "- Loss decreasing slowly (≈0.3 → 0.2)\n",
    "- Fine-tuning weights for best performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Training:**\n",
    "- Model has learned optimal weights\n",
    "- Can make predictions on new transactions!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why not just use more layers?**\n",
    "A: More layers = more capacity, but also:\n",
    "- Slower training\n",
    "- Risk of overfitting (memorizing training data)\n",
    "- Diminishing returns (3 layers often enough for tabular data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if loss doesn't decrease?**\n",
    "A: Could be:\n",
    "- Learning rate too high (try 0.0001)\n",
    "- Learning rate too low (try 0.01)\n",
    "- Bad initialization (run again with different seed)\n",
    "- Insufficient model capacity (add more neurons)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do we know when to stop training?**\n",
    "A: Monitor validation loss:\n",
    "- If training loss ↓ but validation loss ↑ → Overfitting! Stop.\n",
    "- If both ↓ → Keep training\n",
    "- If both plateau → Done! Converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Neural Network:** Function with adjustable weights that learns patterns\n",
    "✅ **Forward Pass:** Input → Hidden Layers → Output (predictions)\n",
    "✅ **Loss Function:** Measures prediction errors (we want to minimize this)\n",
    "✅ **Gradient:** Direction to change weights to reduce loss\n",
    "✅ **Training:** Repeatedly adjust weights to minimize loss\n",
    "✅ **Batch Training:** Process small batches for efficiency\n",
    "✅ **Class Weights:** Handle imbalance by penalizing fraud errors more\n",
